in this part, we are going to have a try with MLP method, and after reading some papers, we are trying to program and implement models with MLP.
but for this part, we did not give a detailed explanation for this method, it is just a try or experience.
when you load this model, we use small dataset (100K movielens), and you should firstly input movie name, this name must must be smae as the movie name in the dataset.
such as 
Waltz with Bashir (Vals im Bashir) (2008)
or
Somers Town (2008)
like these, then we can get recommendations from this model.
